Who have never ever filled a form like this please stand up.

Anyone? Anyone?

Well, you'll have to agree with me that filling forms like this is a PITA! But I understand that may be necessary in certain cases. Maybe in apps that people really need this granularity, this is an easy way to get each field of an address separately.

But if it's not your case and like me you can sacrifice the formalism in order to user experience, I present you <a href="http://code.google.com/p/geo-autocomplete/">geo-autocomplete</a>. It's a nice jQuery plugin to autocomplete location using Google Maps v3 API and Google Static Maps v2 API.

Now you are able to change that gigantic form to a simple textarea, and still have a nicely formatted address. And since the plugin queries the Google Maps v3 API Geocoder, you also get latitude and longitude values. It's fast and smooth, definitely worthwhile to give it a try.
