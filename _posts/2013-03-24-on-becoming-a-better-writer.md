title: On becoming a better writer

Writing is easy, the challenge is to make other people understand what
you say.

As the writer, you are responsible of reviewing your work. Documents
without format standards are unacceptable. Errors in spelling or
punctuation should be reduced to none. Communication is hard already,
you do not need other things to make it more difficult.

I have found some great advices to improve my writing skills. Everyone
who is writing should follow them as well. Applying those may not turn
you into a best-selling author, but it is, at least, a sign of respect
for your reader.
