title: Scrum vs Continuous Delivery
---

A while ago I had the displeasure of hearing from a Project Manager
(PM):

> "I don't do Scrum, I do Continuous Delivery"

All of a sudden there were no more sprint planning, review and
retrospective meetings. Developers started working in a "production
line", solving bugs from the tracking system. Misery all over.

His argument was that working with Continuous Delivery (CD) he would
gain productivity releasing software faster. Clearly the PM
misunderstood some important concepts. Let's clear things up.

[Scrum](http://www.scrumguides.org/) is an agile process based on
time-boxed iterations _during which_ usable and potentially releasable
product increment is created; and the Product Owner may choose to
_immediately release it_.

[CD](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/ContinuousDelivery.html) is a
discipline where you build software in a way it can be _released to
production at any time_. It is about keeping the system in a
production-ready state. It has nothing to do with releasing software
earlier or making sprints shorter.

Based on the definitions, it is clear that if you have software that is
production-ready, you may choose to release it at any time, even during
the iteration. __The "release" is not related to the sprint review
meeting.__

Scrum and CD can perfectly work together. In fact, both should be used
whenever it is possible. CD improves Scrum shortening the feedback loop,
allowing quicker responses for changes, hence leading to a better
product.

If you can have the best of both worlds, why not do it so?
